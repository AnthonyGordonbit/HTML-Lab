            Why did I create this website?
        </h2>

        <p>
            This website was created for my first <strong>HTML</strong> lab in my Web Communications class. This will be expanded upon with CSS.

    <h3>How it went.</h3>
    <p>Creating this website had it's ups and downs.<br> The hardest part for me was linking my visual studio code with github.<br> I had trouble with the organization of my folders which led to my errors on github desktop. Thankfully with time, I sorted out my issues and got my code to link to github.</p>
